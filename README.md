This repo was made from mergeing fixs to nv issues that have been tested to actully work over about 12 years by us directly. Possible Windows And OSX support in the future, as the issues are present on each platforum and share causes about 75%.

-No AI Code!

-Xorg Fixs

-Wayland Fixs

-10 Bit Color Support

Important Notes For Use:

-" nvidia-dkms-***.***.**-0ubuntu0.**.**.*# " and " nvidia-dkms-***-open " Should be changed to match your OS version and NVIDIA Driver version you wish to install otherwise will install newest version avable in system repos.

-At this time the script only runs with each line run by itself in a terminal in general even after that is patched out if any issues are encountered it's best to run it that way anyway will try to make it log so you can at least start where it left off manually.

-Some Parts are extremely incomplete, use at own risk.
